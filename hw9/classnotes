python, returning generators:
return (id, com, seq, qual) # will return tuple (say from def read_foo(...)
id, com, seq, qual = read_foo(...) # unpacks tuple
yield (id, com, seq, qual) # will return generator
for id, com, seq, qual in read_foo(...): # iterates through generator object
good to know for the future:
always know the error rates for your platform/preps that underlie your data

documentation:
its ok to use tables to explain option combinations in docstring
finding words with regex:
re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z']+",...)
re.finditer(r"[a-zA-Z']+",...)
or
re.split((r"[^a-zA-Z']+",...) # contrapositive of the above exampels
python writing:
dont concat strings, explicit string conversion is also a pain
use .format
or use print(word, value, sep='\t')
treat fasta and fastq as binar files rather than bytes:
quality strings could be bytes of fastQ, keep it as pure bytes
fasta files could have
python initializing names:
call them None until you change what they represent
endtrim:
accept empty strings and output them
stochastics:
stochastic model is a computable probability function (we need an algorithm)
strings over a particular alphabet (ACTG - cannonical, ACTGN, AGCTNXHBMDUVRYSW)
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYX,
Alphabet = A
A* = 0 or more letters in a row
A+ = 1 or more letters in a row

iid is indenpendent identity distrribution
conditional probability is P(S|T), S={A,C,T,G,Start}
P(S|T) = P(S,T) / P(T)
eg given sequence AGT, P(x_j=T|x_j-1=G)
P(x_j=T,x_j-1=G) / P(x_j-1=G)
can keep simplifying above formula
joint prob is is P(S,T), smms to 1

Maximum Likelihood Expectation
Lagrangian Multiplier
Coding Cost ==> seq: x, model: m  =
Average Coding Cost, Entropy ==> - SUM ( P(x) log_2 P_m(x) )
Relative Entropy, always positive ==> - SUM ( P_n log (P_m(x) / P_n(x) )
ACC shouldn't go up with addition of new data (if your model is good)
Posterior Odds Ratio ==> P(m|data) / P(n|data)
Likelihood Ratio ==> P(data|m) / P(data|n)
Prior Odds Ratio, n:  ==> P(m) / P(n)

palindrome intro:

counts(GTATAC) / counts(_TATA_) = P(GTATAC|_TATA_)
counts(TATAC) / counts(TATA_) = P(TATAC|TATA_)
counts(GTATA) / counts(_TATA) = P(GTATA|_TATA)

arbitrary gap alignment

dynamic programming for loop:

Global alignment:
Tij = score of best global alignment of x0 ... xi with y0 ... yj
that ends with xi and yj paired
Tij = Sxiyj + max(
		max 0<=k<=i(
			Ti-k-1,j-1 - gap(k)
		max 0<=k<=i(
			Tj-1,j-k-1 - gap(k)    <--- insert x, delete y


basecase: start-start must align at -1,-1 (off matrix) must be zero
11/16/15:
A2M format:
case matters, "-" as extra character (over regular FASTA)
uppercase and "-" means aligned position
lowercase and "-' means insertion
Every sequence has same # of aligned positions
>s1
--AceGH		--AceGH**
>s2			ACA**CEgh
ACACEgh
conveys how other sequences (slave) relate/align to guide sequence (master)
to check if A2M: $checkseq foo -db x.a2m    or at least check if same lengths
